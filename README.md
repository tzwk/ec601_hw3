Exercise 1:
How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the
order of the pixel structure?

Solution:
The program read the cvMat object row by row. (In each row from the 1st (most left) element to the last.) The order of the three channels of each pixel is BGR(blue, green then red).
